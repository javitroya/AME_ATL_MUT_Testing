-- The PNMLDocument rule generates a PNMLDocument  and the NetElement which corresponds to the input PetriNet element. 
-- Name of the generated NetElement is copied from the one of the input PetriNet, by creating a PNML Name composed of a PNML Label which value is initialized by the PetriNet name.
-- Its set of Contents corresponds to the union of the PetriNet Elements and Arcs.
